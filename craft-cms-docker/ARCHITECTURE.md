At its core, this project consists of the following Dockerized services:

- `buildchain` - OPTIONAL: This example demonstrates how an asset pipeline can be incorporated into our development workflow
- `nginx` - A simple front-end to serve static assets and our Craft CMS application
- `php` - This is our Dockerized Craft CMS application
- `database` - MariaDB is a free, open-source database created by the original developers of MySQL.
  - MariaDB is commonly used in place of MySQL because of proprietary code that exists in the MySQL Enterprise Edition that is not commonly available.
    - Please see [MariaDB vs. MySQL: Key Performance Differences](https://www.guru99.com/mariadb-vs-mysql.html) for a general comparison between MariaDB and MySQL
