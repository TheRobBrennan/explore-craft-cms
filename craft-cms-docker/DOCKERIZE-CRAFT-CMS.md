This guide explores creating a Dockerized Craft CMS project.

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos)

### Docker

I recommend downloading and installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for macOS or Windows development.

### Composer

Composer requires PHP v5.3 or newer; however, Craft CMS v3.5.x will need to use PHP v7.0 or newer.

To install Composer, please follow the guide at [https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#system-requirements](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#system-requirements).

Assuming you have PHP installed on your system, you can follow the guide at [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) containing the latest commands to download and install Composer.

```sh
# Example script verifying Composer install instructions as of this writing
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'c31c1e292ad7be5f49291169c0ac8f683499edddcfd4e42232982d0fd193004208a58ff6f353fde0012d35fdd72bc394') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

This will install Composer into your current working directory. Verify that you can run it:

```sh
php composer.phar --version
# Composer version 2.0.2 2020-10-25 23:03:59

# On macOS or Linux, you can install composer globally with the following command
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
composer --version
# Composer version 2.0.2 2020-10-25 23:03:59
```

# Let's go!

After we have verified our development environment is configured correctly, it's time to dive in and start Dockerizing a Craft CMS project.

Please refer to `./craft-cms-docker` - inspired by the tutorial [A Craft CMS Development Workflow With Docker: Part 1 - Local Development](https://mattgrayisok.com/a-craft-cms-development-workflow-with-docker-part-1-local-development)

## Create a Craft CMS project using Docker and composer

First, let's create a new directory to hold the source files for our Craft CMS project.

```sh
# Create a directory for our Craft CMS source files
$ mkdir src

# Use composer to create a basic Craft CMS project
$ cd src
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer create-project craftcms/craft .
```

## Create Docker containers for our new Craft CMS project

We will be creating Docker containers to house the main configuration scripts for each container and any other scripts or assets they need. This enables us to keep our Docker configuration and related files separate from our Craft CMS application.

```sh
# Make sure we're in the craft-cms-docker folder and not the `./craft-cms-docker/src` folder
$ cd ..

# Create a directory structure for our Docker configuration files
$ mkdir -p docker-config/php
$ mkdir -p docker-config/nginx
```

### PHP

Create the Dockerfile for our PHP container at `docker-config/php/Dockerfile`. This container's sole responsibility is to run `php-fpm` - which will parse our PHP files and return appropriate responses.

One benefit of creating our PHP image in this manner is that we can do other things with it down the line - such as mounting temporary test code, deploying to different environments, etc.

### nginx

Create the Dockerfile for our nginx container at `docker-config/nginx/Dockerfile`. This container will use nginx to respond to incoming traffic, respond immediately with a static file, or pass the request on to our PHP container.

#### Custom nginx configuration

We need to override the default nginx configuration to have it forward certain requests to our PHP container. Please see `docker-config/nginx/default.conf` for more details.

The default configuration we are specifying is a pretty standard setup where an nginx server should attempt to server requests using files from the local disk and, if no matching file can be found, transform the request into a request for `index.php` and forward the request to another host/port using fastCGI.

The most important piece for us to focus on is this line - where we are passing the request to our PHP container.

```
fastcgi_pass php:9000;
```

## Create a Docker compose file

Let's define a `docker-compose.yml` file to have a set of containers executed as a single set. Note how we are specifying hostnames such as `php`, `nginx`, and `database`. This will allow our Dockerized app to refer to specific hosts within this configuration. Remember where we had "fastcgi_pass php:9000;" in our nginx configuration? This is where the hostname `php` is defined. ðŸ¤“

One crucial enhancement here is that we have mounted a shared `cpresources` directory in our `php` and `nginx` containers. This was necessary because our application assumes that our web server and PHP server both have access to the same filesystem - which is not the case when they are split into separate containers. By mounting that shared `cpresources` directory, we give the `nginx` container access to any changes or writes from our `php` container.

Please see `craft-cms-docker/docker-compose.yml` for additional details about our Docker compose file.

## Start the Craft CMS project

With our Docker compose file defined, we can start our application:

```sh
# Start the application - See https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/ for more details of the docker-compose CLI
$ docker-compose up

# OPTIONAL: If you would like to force a fresh build of the images and containers before starting the application
$ docker-compose up --build
```

You should be able to see the Craft CMS installation page at [http://localhost/admin/](http://localhost/admin/).

Feel free to play around with your Dockerized app ðŸ¤“

When done, press `CTRL+C` to stop the containers.

```sh
# If you would like to stop your application and keep the containers intact next time you start the project
$ docker-compose stop

# If you would like to destroy and remove the containers created by Docker compose
$ docker-compose rm
```

# Install and configure Craft CMS

If you have followed the _Getting Started_ instructions, your Craft CMS application is ready to be installed and configured.

## Install Craft CMS

You should be able to see the Craft CMS installation page at [http://localhost/admin/](http://localhost/admin/).

Follow the instructions provided by the installation wizard. When finished, you will be at the main dashboard to configure your Craft CMS project.

## Set up an asset source for image uploads

Notice that our `docker-compose.yml` has our `./src/web` directory mounted in the `nginx` and `php` containers. This is so that any files that are written by PHP to this folder will actually be written to our host filesystem and immediately available in our `nginx` container.

To define an asset volume, navigate from the Craft CMS dashboard to `Settings > Content - Assets > Volumes` and then click on `+ New volume`

Create a new asset volume with the following settings:

- Name: `Local`
- Handle: `local`
- Assets in this volume have public URLs: `Enabled`
- Base URL: `@web/images`
- File System Path: `/var/www/html/web/images`

Let's try uploading an image to our asset library. Navigate from the Craft CMS dashboard to `Assets,` make sure `Local` is selected, and then click on `Upload files`

If you can upload an image, continue to the next section. Otherwise, you may need to set relaxed permissions on your host filesystem by doing something like:

```sh
$ cd craft-cms-docker

# Make sure that our images directory is created and set relaxed permissions
$ mkdir src/web/images
$ chmod 777 src/web/images

# Ignore this folder so that we don't include test uploads as part of our source control
$ echo '*\n!.gitignore' > src/web/images/.gitignore
```

## What about logs?

If you have not mounted Craft's `storage` folder to the `php` container, Craft will be writing its log files to the container's file system and not our host system.

To view logs for the `php` container:

```sh
# Make sure we're in the correct directory that contains the docker-compose.yml file we are interested in
$ cd craft-cms-docker

# View the last 200 lines of the application log
$ docker-compose exec php tail -n 200 /var/www/html/storage/logs/web.log

# Pipe the log file into a text editor (such as VS Code) for easy navigating
$ docker-compose exec php cat /var/www/html/storage/logs/web.log | code -
```

# Create a buildchain in Docker

Let's look at an example of how we might create a buildchain that will build our source files into compiled assets.

```sh
# Navigate to the directory containing our desired docker-compose.yml file
$ cd craft-cms-docker

# Create a directory to house all of the configuration needed for our new docker image
$ mkdir -p docker-config/buildchain

# Create directories for our source files
$ mkdir -p src/assets/css
$ mkdir -p src/assets/js

# Create directories for our compiled files
$ mkdir -p src/web/assets/css
$ mkdir -p src/web/assets/js

# Ignore compiled files from source control
$ echo '*\n!.gitignore' > src/web/assets/css/.gitignore
$ echo '*\n!.gitignore' > src/web/assets/js/.gitignore
```

## BONUS: Add npm-watch

Let's have our container recompile whenever changes are made to our assets.

```sh
# Navigate to the directory containing our desired docker-compose.yml file
$ cd craft-cms-docker

# Add npm-watch
$ docker-compose run buildchain yarn add npm-watch --dev
```

Note that we have also added a `watch` section in `craft-cms-docker/docker-config/buildchain/package.json`

To see this in action, run `docker-compose up --build buildchain` and then watch as the compilation process runs if you change any of the `src/assets/css` or `src/assets/js` content.

# Continuous Integration (CI) with Docker and GitLab

[A Craft CMS Development Workflow With Docker: Part 3 - Continuous Integration](https://mattgrayisok.com/a-craft-cms-development-workflow-with-docker-part-3-continuous-integration) does an excellent job explaining why GitLab was chosen to host the repo - and for the CI/CD process.

GitLab offers a free, private container registry for your Docker images. As of this writing, I did come across an announcement from GitHub on September 1st, 2020, which introduces their container registry - [Introducing GitHub Container Registry](https://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry/)

Let's review all of the things that our CI process is doing:

- Installing all the requirements in our before_script, including docker-compose
- Building our buildchain image, which includes
  - Downloading the node base image from docker hub
  - Adding our package.json to it
  - Running yarn install to create our node_modules directory
  - Executing our buildchain to compile assets
- Building our PHP image, which includes
  - Downloading the pl2p-fpm base image from docker hub
  - Installing all of Craft's dependencies
  - Copying our files in
  - Running `composer install`
- Building our nginx image, which includes
  - Downloading the nginx image from docker hub
  - Copying our files in
- Uploading our built PHP and nginx images to the container registry

Please see `craft-cms-docker/.gitlab-ci.yml` for details.

# Docker in Production

[A Craft CMS Development Workflow With Docker: Part 4 - Docker In Production](https://mattgrayisok.com/a-craftcms-development-workflow-with-docker-part-4-docker-in-production) starts by encouraging you to install `Docker` and `docker-compose` with a simple shell script on a server hosted somewhere (such as Digital Ocean, AWS, Azure, etc.)

The real magic here lies in the annotated `craft-cms-docker/.gitlab-ci.yml` file - outlining key steps in the `before_script` and `deploy` sections that automatically deploy changes to the `master` branch to a specific server.

# Testing

[A Craft CMS Development Workflow With Docker: Part 5 - Testing](https://mattgrayisok.com/a-craft-cms-development-workflow-with-docker-part-5-testing) is a great read for testing your application.

## Content

One approach is to test our site in a state similar to our staging or production environments. First, get the site into a representative state locally and dump the database from our `mysql` container. We can restore this dump before running our tests in CI to make sure we're testing against a known state:

```sh
# Navigate to the directory containing our desired docker-compose.yml file
$ cd craft-cms-docker

# Create a directory to store our database dump
$ mkdir dbdumps

# Execute mysqldump within our locally running container and create a new file
$ docker-compose exec database mysqldump -u project -p"project" project > dbdumps/dump.sql
```

We will want to have our CI process use a modified version of our Docker compose file. See `craft-cms-docker/docker-compose-ci.yml`

# Performance

Please see [A Craft CMS Development Workflow With Docker: Part 6 - Performance](https://mattgrayisok.com/a-craft-cms-development-workflow-with-docker-part-6-performance) for running Craft CMS within a Docker container.

# Multi Developer Workflow

Please see [A Craft CMS Development Workflow With Docker: Part 7 - Multi Developer Workflow](https://mattgrayisok.com/a-craft-cms-development-workflow-with-docker-part-7-multi-developer-workflow) on discussing ideas, challenges, and possible solutions for handling multiple developers working on a Craft CMS project.

## The Development Environment

Sage advice:

> Anything required to go from a freshly cloned repo to deploying an updated version of the project is codified within the repo itself.

## Database Schema

Craft CMS offers a Project Config setting that will track any schema changes within the repo.

The easiest thing to do is add the following to `config/general.php`:

```php
'useProjectConfigFile' => true,
```

Beware - here be Dragons!

Some common frustrations that may arise from this method include:

- Manual merges of `project.yaml`
- Slug/handle collisions
