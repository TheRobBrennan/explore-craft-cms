# Our goal

This guide will explore deployment and hosting possibilities for our Craft CMS project.

Our goal is to arrive at a solution that will allow us to:

- Develop and enhance a headless Craft CMS back-end
- Serve Craft CMS content to client applications
- Deploy Craft CMS code to separate environments (e.g., development, staging, hotfixes, etc.)
- Have the ability to manage and revert
  - PHP configuration and changes between environments
  - Craft CMS plug-ins between environments
  - Database schema and optionally data between environments
