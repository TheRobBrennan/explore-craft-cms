## A Craft CMS Development Workflow With Docker

Matt Gray wrote a great series of posts regarding Craft CMS development workflows with Docker. The `craft-cms-in-docker-master` folder reflects the latest code from his repo - last updated roughly a year ago - at [https://gitlab.com/mattgrayisok/craft-cms-in-docker](https://gitlab.com/mattgrayisok/craft-cms-in-docker).

Prerequisites

- You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine.
  - I recommend [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for macOS / Windows development
